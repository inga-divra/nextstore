# Prostore — Full-Stack E-commerce (Educational Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

**Prostore** is a full-stack educational e-commerce project built to deepen my practical understanding of modern web development using **Next.js and React**.

The main goal of this project is not only to build a working online store, but to **practice real-world full-stack architecture**, learn how different technologies interact together, and develop production-ready skills that can be demonstrated in a portfolio and academic coursework.

This project is developed step by step with a strong focus on understanding concepts, not copying solutions.
